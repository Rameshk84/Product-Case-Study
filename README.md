Welcome to my Product Case Study Framework! This guide helps you effectively solve product-related case studies, especially during interviews. 🚀
<br>
**🌟 Overview** <br>
This framework is designed to:<br>

Understand the product's mission and goals 🧭<br>
Identify user pain points and propose impactful solutions 💡<br>
Prioritize efforts for maximum impact 📈<br>
**🔄 Process Workflow** <br> 
1. 📚 Understand the Problem <br>
Carefully read the question to clarify goals and scope.
Ask clarifying questions if the case allows. Example: "Can I assume the role of a product manager?" <br>
**2. 🎯 Define Goals** <br>
a. Broad Product Mission 🌍
E.g., "Improve mental health and happiness globally."
<br>
b. Specific Product/Business Goals 📊
Define measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
Example: Meditation minutes per user (engagement metric).
<br>

**3. 👥 Identify Users** <br>
Segment users based on behavior:

Skeptics: Uninterested/never tried the product.
Rookies: Tried but failed to develop a habit.
Die-hards: Loyal advocates.

**4. 🧩 Identify Pain Points**<br>
Ask questions like:

What challenges prevent users from engaging more?
Which problems occur most frequently?

**5. 🛠️ Propose Solutions** <br>
Use brainstorming to develop 2-3 impactful solutions. Examples:

**Reminders/Notifications 📆** <br>
Calendar integration or physical reminders like stickers.
Social Engagement 🤝
Leaderboards or live reflection meetings.
Gamification 🏅
Badges and rewards for high engagement.


**6. 🔢 Prioritize Solutions** <br>
Evaluate based on:

LOE (Level of Effort): How hard is it to implement?
Impact: How much will it improve KPIs?


**7. 🖼️ Present a Plan** <br>
Summarize your solutions, reasoning, and prioritization into a clear, concise format.
