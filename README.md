📝 Product Case Study Framework
Welcome to my Product Case Study Framework! This guide helps you effectively solve product-related case studies, especially during interviews. 🚀

🌟 Overview
This framework is designed to:

Understand the product's mission and goals 🧭
Identify user pain points and propose impactful solutions 💡
Prioritize efforts for maximum impact 📈
🔄 Process Workflow
1. 📚 Understand the Problem
Carefully read the question to clarify goals and scope.
Ask clarifying questions if the case allows. Example: "Can I assume the role of a product manager?"
2. 🎯 Define Goals
a. Broad Product Mission 🌍
E.g., "Improve mental health and happiness globally."

b. Specific Product/Business Goals 📊
Define measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
Example: Meditation minutes per user (engagement metric).
3. 👥 Identify Users
Segment users based on behavior:

Skeptics: Uninterested/never tried the product.
Rookies: Tried but failed to develop a habit.
Die-hards: Loyal advocates.
4. 🧩 Identify Pain Points
Ask questions like:

What challenges prevent users from engaging more?
Which problems occur most frequently?
5. 🛠️ Propose Solutions
Use brainstorming to develop 2-3 impactful solutions. Examples:

Reminders/Notifications 📆
Calendar integration or physical reminders like stickers.
Social Engagement 🤝
Leaderboards or live reflection meetings.
Gamification 🏅
Badges and rewards for high engagement.
6. 🔢 Prioritize Solutions
Evaluate based on:

LOE (Level of Effort): How hard is it to implement?
Impact: How much will it improve KPIs?
7. 🖼️ Present a Plan
Summarize your solutions, reasoning, and prioritization into a clear, concise format.
